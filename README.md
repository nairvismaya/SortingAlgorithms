# SortingAlgorithms
The functions and events that occur after clicking on each function button are as follows:

1. **Randomize Array**:
   - When you click on the "Randomize Array" button, the bars and their corresponding values in the display will be rearranged randomly. This action shuffles the elements in the array, simulating a random order.

2. **Insertion Sort, Selection Sort, Bubble Sort, Quick Sort, Merge Sort, Shell Sort**:
   - After clicking on any of these sorting algorithm buttons, the selected sorting algorithm will be applied to the bars and their corresponding values.
   - The sorting process will be visually represented by the bars moving and swapping positions in accordance with the selected sorting algorithm.
   - Depending on the algorithm chosen and the initial order of the bars, you will see different sorting behaviors and time complexities.

3. **Change Size**:
   - When you click on the "Change Size" button, the size of the bars in the display will change.
